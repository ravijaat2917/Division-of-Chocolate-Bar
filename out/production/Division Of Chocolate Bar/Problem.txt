Division of the Chocolate Bar
Rohit and Rahul are very close friends, and as Rahul’s birthday is coming up, Rohit decides to share a chocolate bar with him. Rohit has made you the in-charge for the sharing of this chocolate. Each square of the bar has a number written on it, and Rohit has decided that he will share a contiguous piece of chocolate, in which the sum of each number on the squares is equal to the month in which Rahul was born, and the numbers written on these squares add up to Rahul’s birth date. You need to find the number of ways chocolate can be divided.

Input:
1 4 3 5 6 4
18
4

Output:
2

Explanation:
From the input you can get the following:
Consider the chocolate bar as the array of integers. Here the chocolateBar = [1, 4, 3, 5, 6, 4]. Each element of the array indicates the number on the square of the chocolate bar.
The next line is an integer (here, it is ‘18’) indicating the date of Rahul’s birthday.
The next line is an integer (here, it is 4) indicating the month of Rahul’s birthday.
Here, for the given input you can divide the chocolate bar in two ways, they are:
4 3 5 6
3 5 6 4
such that the chocolate piece is contiguous, the number of squares of the chocolate piece is equal to the month in which Rahul was born (here, it is 4), and the sum of the integers present on these square is equal to Rahul’s birth date (here, it is 18).
